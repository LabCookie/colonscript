YOU SHOULDN'T CONSTRUCTIVELY CRITICIZE ON THE PROJECT FOR THINGS I AM ALREADY WORKING ON OR SOMETHING I HAVE EXPLICITLY REFUSED TO DO
e.g: 
- You should add HTML manipulation to make it more useful like javascript! (coming in colon3.0)
- Make it able to directly perform javascript code (no.)
- Hardcoded keywords are inefficient, please make a dynamic dictionary for keywords (coming in colon2.0)
- You should tell a furry vtuber you fell in love with for his voice about it, and say you have to make your own editor just to look cool (Not making that mistake twice.)
- Skibidi toilet (what?)

BLACKLISTED TOPICS:
- Javascript keyword (javascript:perform()). ITS NOT HAPPENING.
- Any complaints about this readme that isn't constructive
  
1.0 ✅
7 ✅
