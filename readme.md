YOU SHOULDN'T CONSTRUCTIVELY CRITICIZE ON THE PROJECT FOR THINGS I AM ALREADY WORKING ON OR SOMETHING I HAVE EXPLICITLY REFUSED TO DO
e.g: 
- You should add HTML manipulation to make it more useful like javascript! (coming in colon3.0)
- Make it able to directly perform javascript code (no.)
- Hardcoded keywords are inefficient, please make a dynamic dictionary for keywords (coming in colon2.0)
- You should tell a furry vtuber you fell in love with for his voice about it, and say you have to make your own editor just to look cool (Not making that mistake twice.)
- Skibidi toilet (what?)

BLACKLISTED TOPICS:
- Javascript keyword (javascript:perform()). ITS NOT HAPPENING.
- Any complaints about this readme that isn't constructive
  
UPCOMING FOR Colon1.0
- Functions to log anything to javascript console (console:log(Hello, World!) or console:log($greeting))
- Variable capabilities (variable:set(greeting,Hello World!))
- Very simplistic math functions (like +, -, /, or *)
- Comments (- this is a comment)
  
UPCOMING FOR Colon2.0
- Dynamic code (instead of hard-coded keywords)
- Importing capabilities (module:require(./Modules/module.colon2))
- Simple font change for the editor (default to arial)
- New functions
- Error Handling
  
UPCOMING FOR Colon3.0
- HTML manipulation (document:element(id))
- Revamped keywords
- Far more appealing editor
- New math functions (like sin and cos)
